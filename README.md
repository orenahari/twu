## Time at work calculation
#### GPS
Based on Google timeline data.
Requires a logged-in chrome session (until further notice).
GPS data is taken from the parsed KML file that can be downloaded per a single date which 
describes a single day timeline data.

#### Non-GPS
If GPS data did not indicate that user was a work, the mode switches to non-gps.
This means that either eve/holiday or work from home which requires setting an appropriate excuse.

#### Holidays
Holidays are detected from the headline in the single day edit menu in the web page.
The headline is compared to the ascii representation of the specific language in which the web page is written.
Holidays are set according the index (zero based) provided in the parameters (index of the correct option in the drop down menu when manually setting).

i.e:
If clicking on the drop down menu in the single day edit web-page is:
* hi
* holiday_eve
* holiday
* bye

Then 
* `holiday_index = 3` 
* `holiday_eve_index = 2`
* `holiday_text = [104, 111, 108, 105, 100, 97, 121]`
* `holiday_eve_text = [104, 111, 108, 105, 100, 97, 121, 95, 101, 118, 101]`

You can find ascii encoding our using the built-in function `ord()`:
```
description = 'vacation day'
[ord(x) for x in description]

>>>
[118, 97, 99, 97, 116, 105, 111, 110, 32, 100, 97, 121]
```

### Geo Data
  
Go to [Google Maps](https://www.google.co.il/maps) 
and extract the exact coordinates from the location:
```
right click on the address:
whats here?
```

Select Decimal Degrees notation:

|Lat|Long|
|:----|:----|
|32.166525|32.166525|


should be entered into parameters JSON as
    
    "work": {
        "location": {
            "lat": "32.166525",
            "long": "34.812895"
        }
    }
